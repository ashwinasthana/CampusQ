## About
CampusQ revolutionizes campus queue management by providing a smart, digital solution that eliminates physical waiting lines. Students, faculty, and staff can join virtual queues, track wait times in real-time, and receive notifications when it's their turn - all from their mobile devices.

Our platform serves cafeterias, libraries, administrative offices, labs, and any campus facility where queuing is necessary, making campus life more efficient and stress-free.

---

## Problem Statement
Campus queues are a daily frustration:
- ‚è∞ **Time Waste** - Students spend hours waiting in physical lines
- üò§ **Stress & Anxiety** - Uncertainty about wait times creates pressure
- üì± **Digital Gap** - Most campuses still rely on outdated queue systems
- ü¶† **Health Concerns** - Physical queues increase contact and crowding
- üìä **Poor Analytics** - Facilities can't optimize operations without data

CampusQ solves these problems with intelligent, data-driven queue management.

## Demo
**Live Platform:** [https://campus-q-two.vercel.app](https://campus-q-two.vercel.app)

**Test Accounts:**
- Student: `student@campus.edu` / `demo123`
- Staff: `staff@campus.edu` / `demo456`
- Admin: `admin@campus.edu` / `admin789`

**Demo Scenarios:**
1. Join a cafeteria queue and track your position
2. Receive real-time notifications
3. View facility analytics (admin only)
